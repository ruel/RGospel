No one had the strength to subdue him. Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out and cutting himself with stones.

His father came out and entreated him,</span> <span class="woc">but he answered his father, &#8216;Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might celebrate with my friends.</span> <span class="woc">But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him!&#8217;</span> <span class="woc">And he said to him, &#8216;Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.</span> <span class="woc">It was fitting to celebrate and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p></div></div>

Jacob's well was there; so Jesus, wearied as he was from his journey, was sitting beside the well. It was about the sixth hour.</p> <p id="p43004007.01-1">A woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, <span class="woc">&#8220;Give me a drink.&#8221;</span> (For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.) The Samaritan woman said to him, &#8220;How is it that you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a woman of Samaria?&#8221; (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.) Jesus answered her, <span class="woc">&#8220;If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, &#8216;Give me a drink,&#8217; you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.&#8221;</span> The woman said to him, &#8220;Sir, you have nothing to draw water with, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water? Are you greater than our father Jacob? He gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock.&#8221; Jesus said to her, <span class="woc">&#8220;Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again,</span> <span class="woc">but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again. The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.&#8221;</span> The woman said to him, &#8220;Sir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water.&#8221;</p> <p id="p43004016.01-1">Jesus said to her, <span class="woc">&#8220;Go, call your husband, and come here.&#8221;</span> The woman answered him, &#8220;I have no husband.&#8221; Jesus said to her, <span class="woc">&#8220;You are right in saying, &#8216;I have no husband&#8217;;</span> <span class="woc">for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.&#8221;</span> The woman said to him, &#8220;Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.&#8221; Jesus said to her, <span class="woc">&#8220;Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.</span> <span class="woc">You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.</span> <span class="woc">But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.</span> <span class="woc">God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.&#8221;</span> The woman said to him, &#8220;I know that Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ). When he comes, he will tell us all things.&#8221; Jesus said to her, <span class="woc">&#8220;I who speak to you am he.&#8221;</span></p> <p id="p43004027.01-1">Just then his disciples came back. They marveled that he was talking with a woman, but no one said, &#8220;What do you seek?&#8221; or, &#8220;Why are you talking with her?&#8221; So the woman left her water jar and went away into town and said to the people, &#8220;Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ?&#8221; They went out of the town and were coming to him.</p> <p id="p43004031.01-1">Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, saying, &#8220;Rabbi, eat.&#8221; But he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;I have food to eat that you do not know about.&#8221;</span> So the disciples said to one another, &#8220;Has anyone brought him something to eat?&#8221; Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work.</span> <span class="woc">Do you not say, &#8216;There are yet four months, then comes the harvest&#8217;? Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see that the fields are white for harvest.</span> <span class="woc">Already</span> <span class="woc">the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together.</span> <span class="woc">For here the saying holds true, &#8216;One sows and another reaps.&#8217;</span> <span class="woc">I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.&#8221;</span></p> <p id="p43004039.01-1">Many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, &#8220;He told me all that I ever did.&#8221; So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days. And many more believed because of his word. They said to the woman, &#8220;It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world.&#8221;</p></div></div>

Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. So the Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. And he said to them, &#8220;He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.&#8221; Some of the Pharisees said, &#8220;This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.&#8221; But others said, &#8220;How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?&#8221; And there was a division among them. So they said again to the blind man, &#8220;What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?&#8221; He said, &#8220;He is a prophet.&#8221;</p> <p id="p43009018.01-1">The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight and asked them, &#8220;Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?&#8221; His parents answered, &#8220;We know that this is our son and that he was born blind. But how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself.&#8221; (His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess Jesus to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue.) Therefore his parents said, &#8220;He is of age; ask him.&#8221;</p> <p id="p43009024.01-1">So for the second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, &#8220;Give glory to God.

One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.&#8221; They said to him, &#8220;What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?&#8221; He answered them, &#8220;I have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?&#8221; And they reviled him, saying, &#8220;You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.&#8221; The man answered, &#8220;Why, this is an amazing thing! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes. We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens to him. Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind. If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.&#8221; They answered him, &#8220;You were born in utter sin, and would you teach us?&#8221; And they cast him out.</p> <p id="p43009035.01-1">Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him he said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Do you believe in the Son of Man?&#8221;</span> He answered, &#8220;And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?&#8221; Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;You have seen him, and it is he who is speaking to you.&#8221;</span> He said, &#8220;Lord, I believe,&#8221; and he worshiped him. Jesus said, <span class="woc">&#8220;For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.&#8221;</span> Some of the Pharisees near him heard these things, and said to him, &#8220;Are we also blind?&#8221; Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;If you were blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, &#8216;We see,&#8217; your guilt remains.</span></p></div></div>

As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was recovering. So he asked them the hour when he began to get better, and they said to him, &#8220;Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.&#8221; The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Your son will live.&#8221;</span> And he himself believed, and all his household.

He would not go about in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill him. Now the Jews' Feast of Booths was at hand. So his brothers said to him, &#8220;Leave here and go to Judea, that your disciples also may see the works you are doing. For no one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.&#8221; For not even his brothers believed in him. Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;My time has not yet come, but your time is always here.</span> <span class="woc">The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it that its works are evil.</span> <span class="woc">You go up to the feast. I am not going up to this feast, for my time has not yet fully come.&#8221;</span> After saying this, he remained in Galilee.</p> <p id="p43007010.01-1">But after his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly but in private. The Jews were looking for him at the feast, and saying, &#8220;Where is he?&#8221; And there was much muttering about him among the people. While some said, &#8220;He is a good man,&#8221; others said, &#8220;No, he is leading the people astray.&#8221; Yet for fear of the Jews no one spoke openly of him.</p> <p id="p43007014.01-1">About the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching. The Jews therefore marveled, saying, &#8220;How is it that this man has learning, when he has never studied?&#8221; So Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.</span> <span class="woc">If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.</span> <span class="woc">The one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory; but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood.</span> <span class="woc">Has not Moses given you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?&#8221;</span> The crowd answered, &#8220;You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?&#8221; Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;I did one work, and you all marvel at it.</span> <span class="woc">Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="woc">If on the Sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man's whole body well?</span> <span class="woc">Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.&#8221;</span></p> <h3 id="p43007025.01-1">Can This Be the Christ?</h3><p id="p43007025.06-1">Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said, &#8220;Is not this the man whom they seek to kill? And here he is, speaking openly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ? But we know where this man comes from, and when the Christ appears, no one will know where he comes from.&#8221; So Jesus proclaimed, as he taught in the temple, <span class="woc">&#8220;You know me, and you know where I come from? But I have not come of my own accord. He who sent me is true, and him you do not know.</span> <span class="woc">I know him, for I come from him, and he sent me.&#8221;</span> So they were seeking to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.</p></div></div>

Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him.</p> <p id="p43007045.01-1">The officers then came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, &#8220;Why did you not bring him?&#8221; The officers answered, &#8220;No one ever spoke like this man!&#8221; The Pharisees answered them, &#8220;Have you also been deceived? Have any of the authorities or the Pharisees believed in him? But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed.&#8221; Nicodemus, who had gone to him before, and who was one of them, said to them, &#8220;Does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he does?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Are you from Galilee too?

It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill. So the sisters sent to him, saying, &#8220;Lord, he whom you love is ill.&#8221; But when Jesus heard it he said, <span class="woc">&#8220;This illness does not lead to death. It is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.&#8221;</span></p> <p id="p43011005.01-1">Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. So, when he heard that Lazarus was ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was. Then after this he said to the disciples, <span class="woc">&#8220;Let us go to Judea again.&#8221;</span> The disciples said to him, &#8220;Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?&#8221; Jesus answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</span> <span class="woc">But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.&#8221;</span> After saying these things, he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him.&#8221;</span> The disciples said to him, &#8220;Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.&#8221; Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep. Then Jesus told them plainly, <span class="woc">&#8220;Lazarus has died,</span> <span class="woc">and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.&#8221;</span> So Thomas, called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, &#8220;Let us also go, that we may die with him.&#8221;</p> <h3 id="p43011017.01-1">I Am the Resurrection and the Life</h3><p id="p43011017.08-1">Now when Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days. Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off, and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother. So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary remained seated in the house. Martha said to Jesus, &#8220;Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. But even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you.&#8221; Jesus said to her, <span class="woc">&#8220;Your brother will rise again.&#8221;</span> Martha said to him, &#8220;I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.&#8221; Jesus said to her, <span class="woc">&#8220;I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live,</span> <span class="woc">and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?&#8221;</span> She said to him, &#8220;Yes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world.&#8221;</p> <h3 id="p43011028.01-1">Jesus Weeps</h3><p id="p43011028.03-1">When she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying in private, &#8220;The Teacher is here and is calling for you.&#8221; And when she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him. Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him. When the Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary rise quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there. Now when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, &#8220;Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.&#8221; When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in his spirit and greatly troubled. And he said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Where have you laid him?&#8221;</span> They said to him, &#8220;Lord, come and see.&#8221; Jesus wept. So the Jews said, &#8220;See how he loved him!&#8221; But some of them said, &#8220;Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man also have kept this man from dying?&#8221;</p> <h3 id="p43011038.01-1">Jesus Raises Lazarus</h3><p id="p43011038.04-1">Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it. Jesus said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Take away the stone.&#8221;</span> Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, &#8220;Lord, by this time there will be an odor, for he has been dead four days.&#8221; Jesus said to her, <span class="woc">&#8220;Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?&#8221;</span> So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</span> <span class="woc">I knew that you always hear me, but I said this on account of the people standing around, that they may believe that you sent me.&#8221;</span> When he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice, <span class="woc">&#8220;Lazarus, come out.&#8221;</span> The man who had died came out, his hands and feet bound with linen strips, and his face wrapped with a cloth.

Now in the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?&#8221; This they said to test him, that they might have some charge to bring against him.

And as they were eating, he said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.&#8221;</span> And they were very sorrowful and began to say to him one after another, &#8220;Is it I, Lord?&#8221; He answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me.</span> <span class="woc">The Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.&#8221;</span> Judas, who would betray him, answered, &#8220;Is it I, Rabbi?&#8221; He said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;You have said so.&#8221;</span></p> <h3 id="p40026026.01-1">Institution of the Lord's Supper</h3><p id="p40026026.06-1">Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Take, eat; this is my body.&#8221;</span> And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, <span class="woc">&#8220;Drink of it, all of you,</span> <span class="woc">for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</span> <span class="woc">I tell you I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.&#8221;</span></p> <h3 id="p40026030.01-1">Jesus Foretells Peter's Denial</h3><p id="p40026030.05-1">And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;You will all fall away because of me this night. For it is written, &#8216;I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.&#8217;</span> <span class="woc">But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.&#8221;</span> Peter answered him, &#8220;Though they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away.&#8221; Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.&#8221;</span> Peter said to him, &#8220;Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you!&#8221; And all the disciples said the same.</p> <h3 id="p40026036.01-1">Jesus Prays in Gethsemane</h3><p id="p40026036.05-1">Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, <span class="woc">&#8220;Sit here, while I go over there and pray.&#8221;</span> And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled. Then he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me.&#8221;</span> And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, saying, <span class="woc">&#8220;My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.&#8221;</span> And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, <span class="woc">&#8220;So, could you not watch with me one hour?</span> <span class="woc">Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.&#8221;</span> Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, <span class="woc">&#8220;My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.&#8221;</span> And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words again. Then he came to the disciples and said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Sleep and take your rest later on. See, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="woc">Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.&#8221;</span></p> <h3 id="p40026047.01-1">Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus</h3><p id="p40026047.06-1">While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people. Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, &#8220;The one I will kiss is the man; seize him.&#8221; And he came up to Jesus at once and said, &#8220;Greetings, Rabbi!&#8221; And he kissed him. Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Friend, do what you came to do.&#8221;</span> Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him. And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear. Then Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.</span> <span class="woc">Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?</span> <span class="woc">But how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?&#8221;</span> At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, <span class="woc">&#8220;Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.</span> <span class="woc">But all this has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.&#8221;</span> Then all the disciples left him and fled.</p> <h3 id="p40026057.01-1">Jesus Before Caiaphas and the Council</h3><p id="p40026057.07-1">Then those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered. And Peter was following him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end. Now the chief priests and the whole Council were seeking false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death, but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward and said, &#8220;This man said, &#8216;I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to rebuild it in three days.&#8217;&#8221; And the high priest stood up and said, &#8220;Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?&#8221; But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, &#8220;I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.&#8221; Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.&#8221;</span> Then the high priest tore his robes and said, &#8220;He has uttered blasphemy. What further witnesses do we need? You have now heard his blasphemy. What is your judgment?&#8221; They answered, &#8220;He deserves death.&#8221;</p></div></div>

So they gave a dinner for him there. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those reclining with him at table. Mary therefore took a pound of expensive ointment made from pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (he who was about to betray him), said, &#8220;Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?&#8221; He said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief, and having charge of the moneybag he used to help himself to what was put into it. Jesus said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Leave her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of my burial.</span> <span class="woc">For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.&#8221;</span></p> <h3 id="p43012009.01-1">The Plot to Kill Lazarus</h3><p id="p43012009.06-1">When the large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there, they came, not only on account of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. So the chief priests made plans to put Lazarus to death as well, because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.</p></div></div>

One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining at table close to Jesus, so Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking. So that disciple, leaning back against Jesus, said to him, &#8220;Lord, who is it?&#8221; Jesus answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;It is he to whom I will give this morsel of bread when I have dipped it.&#8221;</span> So when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. Then after he had taken the morsel, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;What you are going to do, do quickly.&#8221;</span> Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him. Some thought that, because Judas had the moneybag, Jesus was telling him, &#8220;Buy what we need for the feast,&#8221; or that he should give something to the poor. So, after receiving the morsel of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.</p> <h3 id="p43013031.01-1">A New Commandment</h3><p id="p43013031.04-1">When he had gone out, Jesus said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</span> <span class="woc">If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once.</span> <span class="woc">Little children, yet a little while I am with you.

Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples. So Judas, having procured a band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, went there with lanterns and torches and weapons. Then Jesus, knowing all that would happen to him, came forward and said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Whom do you seek?&#8221;</span> They answered him, &#8220;Jesus of Nazareth.&#8221; Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;I am he.&#8221;</span> Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them.

So he asked them again, <span class="woc">&#8220;Whom do you seek?&#8221;</span> And they said, &#8220;Jesus of Nazareth.&#8221; Jesus answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;I told you that I am he.

(The servant's name was Malchus.) So Jesus said to Peter, <span class="woc">&#8220;Put your sword into its sheath; shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?&#8221;</span></p> <h3 id="p43018012.01-1">Jesus Faces Annas and Caiaphas</h3><p id="p43018012.06-1">So the band of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him.

It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it would be expedient that one man should die for the people.</p> <h3 id="p43018015.01-1">Peter Denies Jesus</h3><p id="p43018015.04-1">Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he entered with Jesus into the court of the high priest, but Peter stood outside at the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the servant girl who kept watch at the door, and brought Peter in. The servant girl at the door said to Peter, &#8220;You also are not one of this man's disciples, are you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I am not.&#8221; Now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves. Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.</p> <h3 id="p43018019.01-1">The High Priest Questions Jesus</h3><p id="p43018019.06-1">The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. Jesus answered him, <span class="woc">&#8220;I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all Jews come together. I have said nothing in secret.</span> <span class="woc">Why do you ask me?

So they said to him, &#8220;You also are not one of his disciples, are you?&#8221; He denied it and said, &#8220;I am not.&#8221; One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, &#8220;Did I not see you in the garden with him?&#8221; Peter again denied it, and at once a rooster crowed.</p> <h3 id="p43018028.01-1">Jesus Before Pilate</h3><p id="p43018028.04-1">Then they led Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the governor's headquarters. It was early morning. They themselves did not enter the governor's headquarters, so that they would not be defiled, but could eat the Passover. So Pilate went outside to them and said, &#8220;What accusation do you bring against this man?&#8221; They answered him, &#8220;If this man were not doing evil, we would not have delivered him over to you.&#8221; Pilate said to them, &#8220;Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.&#8221; The Jews said to him, &#8220;It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.&#8221; This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken to show by what kind of death he was going to die.</p> <h3 id="p43018033.01-1">My Kingdom Is Not of This World</h3><p id="p43018033.08-1">So Pilate entered his headquarters again and called Jesus and said to him, &#8220;Are you the King of the Jews?&#8221; Jesus answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;Do you say this of your own accord, or did others say it to you about me?&#8221;</span> Pilate answered, &#8220;Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you over to me. What have you done?&#8221; Jesus answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.&#8221;</span> Then Pilate said to him, &#8220;So you are a king?&#8221; Jesus answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;You say that I am a king. For this purpose I was born and for this purpose I have come into the world&#8212;to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice.&#8221;</span> Pilate said to him, &#8220;What is truth?&#8221;</p><p id="p43018038.08-1">After he had said this, he went back outside to the Jews and told them, &#8220;I find no guilt in him. But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?&#8221; They cried out again, &#8220;Not this man, but Barabbas!&#8221; Now Barabbas was a robber.</p> <h3 id="p43019001.01-1">Jesus Delivered to Be Crucified</h3><p id="p43019001.06-1"><span class="chapter-num" id="v43019001-1">19:1&nbsp;</span>Then Pilate took Jesus and flogged him. And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head and arrayed him in a purple robe. They came up to him, saying, &#8220;Hail, King of the Jews!&#8221; and struck him with their hands. Pilate went out again and said to them, &#8220;See, I am bringing him out to you that you may know that I find no guilt in him.&#8221; So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, &#8220;Behold the man!&#8221; When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, &#8220;Crucify him, crucify him!&#8221; Pilate said to them, &#8220;Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no guilt in him.&#8221; The Jews answered him, &#8220;We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die because he has made himself the Son of God.&#8221; When Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid. He entered his headquarters again and said to Jesus, &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; But Jesus gave him no answer. So Pilate said to him, &#8220;You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?&#8221; Jesus answered him, <span class="woc">&#8220;You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given you from above. Therefore he who delivered me over to you has the greater sin.&#8221;</span></p> <p id="p43019012.01-1">From then on Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, &#8220;If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend. Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.&#8221; So when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Stone Pavement, and in Aramaic Gabbatha. Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover. It was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, &#8220;Behold your King!&#8221; They cried out, &#8220;Away with him, away with him, crucify him!&#8221; Pilate said to them, &#8220;Shall I crucify your King?&#8221; The chief priests answered, &#8220;We have no king but Caesar.&#8221; So he delivered him over to them to be crucified.</p><h3 id="p43019016.11-1">The Crucifixion</h3><p id="p43019016.13-1">So they took Jesus, and he went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called The Place of a Skull, which in Aramaic is called Golgotha. There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them. Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, &#8220;Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.&#8221; Many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek. So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, &#8220;Do not write, &#8216;The King of the Jews,&#8217; but rather, &#8216;This man said, I am King of the Jews.&#8217;&#8221; Pilate answered, &#8220;What I have written I have written.&#8221;</p> <p id="p43019023.01-1">When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom, so they said to one another, &#8220;Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be.&#8221; This was to fulfill the Scripture which says,</p><div class="block-indent"><p class="line-group" id="p43019024.31-1">&#8220;They divided my garments among them,<br /><span class="indent"></span>and for my clothing they cast lots.&#8221;</p></div><p class="same-paragraph" id="p43019024.44-1">So the soldiers did these things, but standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, <span class="woc">&#8220;Woman, behold, your son!&#8221;</span> Then he said to the disciple, <span class="woc">&#8220;Behold, your mother!&#8221;</span> And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</p> <h3 id="p43019028.01-1">The Death of Jesus</h3><p id="p43019028.05-1">After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfill the Scripture), <span class="woc">&#8220;I thirst.&#8221;</span> A jar full of sour wine stood there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth. When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, <span class="woc">&#8220;It is finished,&#8221;</span> and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</p> <h3 id="p43019031.01-1">Jesus' Side Is Pierced</h3><p id="p43019031.05-1">Since it was the day of Preparation, and so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away. So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water. He who saw it has borne witness&#8212;his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth&#8212;that you also may believe. For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled: &#8220;Not one of his bones will be broken.&#8221; And again another Scripture says, &#8220;They will look on him whom they have pierced.&#8221;</p> <h3 id="p43019038.01-1">Jesus Is Buried</h3><p id="p43019038.04-1">After these things Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away his body. Nicodemus also, who earlier had come to Jesus by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds in weight. So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews. Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, since the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.</p></div></div>

Both of them were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying there, and the face cloth, which had been on Jesus' head, not lying with the linen cloths but folded up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; for as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.</p></div></div>

They said to her, &#8220;Woman, why are you weeping?&#8221; She said to them, &#8220;They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.&#8221; Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus.

While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. And he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?&#8221;</span> And they stood still, looking sad. Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, &#8220;Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?&#8221; And he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;What things?&#8221;</span> And they said to him, &#8220;Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.&#8221; And he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</span> <span class="woc">Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?&#8221;</span> And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.</p> <p id="p42024028.01-1">So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He acted as if he were going farther, but they urged him strongly, saying, &#8220;Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.&#8221; So he went in to stay with them. When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them. And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their sight. They said to each other, &#8220;Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?&#8221; And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, saying, &#8220;The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!&#8221; Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.</p></div></div>

The other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, but about a hundred yards off.</p> <p id="p43021009.01-1">When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire in place, with fish laid out on it, and bread.

While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. And he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?&#8221;</span> And they stood still, looking sad. Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, &#8220;Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?&#8221; And he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;What things?&#8221;</span> And they said to him, &#8220;Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.&#8221; And he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</span> <span class="woc">Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?&#8221;</span> And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.</p> <p id="p42024028.01-1">So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He acted as if he were going farther, but they urged him strongly, saying, &#8220;Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.&#8221; So he went in to stay with them. When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them. And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their sight. They said to each other, &#8220;Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?&#8221; And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, saying, &#8220;The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!&#8221; Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.</p></div></div>
